It is split into two files, for DC and Marvel, respectively: `dc-wikia-data.csv` and `marvel-wikia-data.csv`. Each file has the following variables:\n",

    "`ALIGN` | If the character is Good, Bad or Neutral\n",
    "`EYE` | Eye color of the character\n",
    "`HAIR` | Hair color of the character\n",
    "`SEX` | Sex of the character (e.g. Male, Female, etc.)\n",
    "`GSM` | If the character is a gender or sexual minority (e.g. Homosexual characters, bisexual characters)\n",
    "`ALIVE` | If the character is alive or deceased\n",
    "`APPEARANCES` | The number of appareances of the character in comic books (as of Sep. 2, 2014. Number will become increasingly out of date as time goes on.)\n",
    "`FIRST APPEARANCE` | The month and year of the character's first appearance in a comic book, if available\n",
